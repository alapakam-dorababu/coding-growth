### Platform Independent  
- Python code runs on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux) without modification.  

### Huge Community Support  
- A large global community provides resources, frameworks, and support.  

### Automation & Scripting  
- Used for writing automation scripts to handle repetitive tasks.  

### Integration Capabilities  
- Can integrate with C, C++, Java, and other languages.

# Python Simple Class Example

```py title="example.py" linenums="1" 
class Person:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def greet(self):
        return f"Hello, my name is {self.name} and I am {self.age} years old."

# Create an object of the class
person1 = Person("Alice", 25)

# Call the method
print(person1.greet())
```
