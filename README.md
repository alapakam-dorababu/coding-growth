# Coding Growth  ![status](https://github.com/alapakam-dorababu/coding-growth/actions/workflows/deploy.yml/badge.svg)

**Coding Growth** is my personal blog where I write about what I learn and keep important references for future use.  

### Why this blog?  
- To track my coding journey  
- To explore and understand new programming concepts  
- To save useful resources in one place  

This blog is like my personal notebook, helping me grow as a developer while making it easier to revisit and apply what I've learned.
